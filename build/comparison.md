## Kintelligence / k2v SNP count comparison

k2v joins the `<sample>.SnpResult.txt` to an allele table to get
genotypes which are used to convert to VCF.

Building the k2v allele table starts with the
[`hg19_mapping.tsv`](hg19_mapping.tsv) file provided by Verogen, which
contains RSIDs, chromosome, and position information for 10,380 SNPs,
including 125 and 90 on the X and Y chromosomes, respectively. 10,230 of
these SNPs are genotyped and included in the `<sample>.SnpResult.txt`
output, including 106 and 85 on the X and Y chromosomes, respectively.

The allele table is created by extracting biallelic SNPs from GnomAD
genomes for 1-22 and X using the GRCh37 GnomAD site VCF. Y chromosome
sites from GnomAD are not available on GRCh37, so the GRCh38 Y
chromosome site VCF from GnomAD is lifted over to GRCh37 prior to
extracting Y chromosome kintelligence sites. Reference and alternate
alleles are extracted from the GnomAD site VCF(s) and used for
converting 0/0, 0/1, 1/1 genotypes in the `<sample>.SnpResult.txt`.

Not all of the sites in `hg19_mapping.tsv` and provided in
`<sample>.SnpResult.txt` are in GnomAD by both position and RSID. The
table below compares by chromosome sites generated by Kintelligence with
whatâ€™s present in GnomAD (and ultimately output by k2v). 51 SNPs are not
captured by k2v.
